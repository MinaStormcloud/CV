    <h3>Work Experience</h3>
    <p></p>
    <h4>Cloud Security Test Manager | 2023</h4>
    <p></p>
    <p>Quality assurance and coordination of test activities. Identity & Access Management, cloud
        security, regression testing, and GDPR/PDL compliance were among my main
        responsibilities.</p>
    <p></p>
    <h4>.NET Developer (Consultant) | 2021</h4>
    <p>As a test developer, I was responsible for writing test cases for international 
        websites. My solution verified that all buttons, links, and forms worked properly. 
        To confirm the successful execution of each test case, I added screenshot functionality 
        to the test flow. The role also included some front-end tasks in Sitecore.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <h4>Technical Writer (Consultant) | 2019 - 2020</h4>
    <p>Converting Adobe FrameMaker documents into Arbortext Editor format.</p>
    <p></p>
    <h4>.NET Developer & Technical Writer | 2017 - 2019</h4>
    <p>Evaluation of technology options from a business point of view.
        Translation of documents describing production line automation processes.
        Development of a web application for systems monitoring and real-time
        notifications.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <h4>.NET Developer & QA Engineer | 2008 - 2017</h4>
    <p>My initial task was to perform functionality and acceptance tests, using a tool that
        I also helped develop. As a software test engineer, I verified the quality and
        functionality of download tools, application software and boot versions. In 2010,
        I became a test coordinator. In that role, I created all the documentation required
        for quality inspection in our factories worldwide. Any issues encountered were
        reported back to me, and I performed additional tests to come up with a solution
        for the teams in the factories.</p>                
    <p></p>
    <h4>IAM Administrator (Consultant) | 2007 - 2008</h4>
    <p>
        As an IAM administrator, I created and updated corporate user accounts in an Active
        Directory environment and supported the HR and Helpdesk teams on a daily basis.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <h4>Invoice Administrator | 1999 - 2007</h4>
    <p>Between 2002 and 2006, I worked nights while pursuing my BSc in Informatics.</p>
