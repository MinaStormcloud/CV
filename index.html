            team member, one of my key contributions is to bridge the gap between different
            areas of responsibility in large projects. I love taking on new challenges.</p>

    <h3>Work Experience</h3>
    <p></p>
    <h4>Cloud Security Test Manager IBM CIC | 2023</h4>
    <p></p>
    <p>Quality assurance and coordination of test activities for the Millennium project
        (Västra Götalandsregionen, Mölndal). Identity & Access Management, cloud
        security, regression testing, and GDPR/PDL compliance were among my main
        responsibilities.</p>
    <p></p>
    <h4>.NET Developer Ikano Bank (Consultant) | 2021</h4>
    <p>As a test developer, I was responsible for writing test cases for Ikano Bank’s
        international websites. My solution verified that all buttons, links, and forms
        worked properly. To confirm the successful execution of each test case, I added
        screenshot functionality to the test flow. The role also included some front-end
        tasks in Sitecore.
    </p>

    <h4>Technical Writer Tetra Pak (Consultant) | 2019 - 2020</h4>
    <p>Converting Adobe FrameMaker documents into Arbortext Editor format.</p>
    <p></p>
    <h4>.NET Developer & Technical Writer ÅF | 2017 - 2019</h4>
    <p>Evaluation of technology options from a business point of view.
        Translation of documents describing production line automation processes.
        Development of a web application for systems monitoring and real-time
        notifications.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <h4>.NET Developer & QA Engineer Sony | 2008 - 2017</h4>
    <p>My initial task was to perform functionality and acceptance tests, using a tool that
        I also helped develop. As a software test engineer, I verified the quality and
        functionality of download tools, application software and boot versions. In 2010,
        I became a test coordinator. In that role, I created all the documentation required
        for quality inspection in our factories worldwide. Any issues encountered were
        reported back to me, and I performed additional tests to come up with a solution
        for the teams in the factories.</p>
        <p>In 2011, I joined another department within Sony as a security test engineer. Our
        test automation scripts were written in Python, and I updated them before each
        boot version release. Software was created incrementally, and software releases
        were managed using Jenkins. The main purpose of our security test activities was
        to verify that hacked software would not boot up the phones. Occasionally, I also
        did some minor electrical repair work on prototypes.</p>
        <p>All my roles at Sony Ericsson/Sony gave me a lot of experience with international
        teams. Since I created a lot of documentation for previously undocumented
        areas, I gathered large amounts of information from other test engineers,
        developers, managers, and project managers in our international community,
        which also taught me how to facilitate communication between colleagues
        without a shared terminology.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <h4>IAM Administrator Sony Ericsson (Consultant) | 2007 - 2008</h4>
    <p>This was my first role at Sony Ericsson, and I joined the ProfileView Identity &
        Access Management team a few months after getting my BSc in Informatics. As
        an IAM administrator, I created and updated corporate user accounts in an Active
        Directory environment and supported the HR and Helpdesk teams on a daily
        basis.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <h4>Invoice Administrator WM Data | 1999 - 2007</h4>
    <p>Between 2002 and 2006, I worked nights while pursuing my BSc in Informatics.</p>
